## To do
- [X] Setup **EXP_TRACK** environment
- [X] Add Vision Transformer architecture
- [X] Add Cifar10 datamodule pytorch-lightning datamodule
- [ ] Write pytorch-lightning (pl) classification script
  - [X] Simple script mimicking pl_hydra template
  - [-] Save the model (best)
  - [-] Tensorboard should have meaningful metrics and outputs
  - [-] Output figures, test figures, confusion matrix
- [ ] Replicate the same for wandb experiment tracker (Create a separate branch)
- [ ] Do sweep run in wandb
- [ ] Replicate the same for mlfl experiment  (Create a separate branch)
- [ ] Combine all three into single branch
